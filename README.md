==========


This is the source code for the Bitcoin Businesses Android App . You can see the currently released version here : https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ragmondo

I don't have enough time to develop this app properly so thought I would put it out to the community to do with as it will. 

The only condition is regarding the data access - if you do use the /json or /kml endpoints to access the bitcoin business directory, then you must include the server generated links at the end.

Other than that, feel free ! Let me know if you want push access btw.
